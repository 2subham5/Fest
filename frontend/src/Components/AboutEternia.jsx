          About Eternia
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-6 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
          Eternia is one of the largest medical college fest in Northeast India — 
          a four-day extravaganza that brings together culture, sports, literature, 
          and pure fun in one unforgettable celebration.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          From electrifying sports tournaments and thought-provoking literary 
          showdowns to cultural showcases and casual crowd-favorites like 
          <span className="font-semibold"> Beg, Borrow, Steal </span> and the 
          <span className="font-semibold"> Treasure Hunt</span>, Eternia has something 
          for everyone. The festival reaches its crescendo each year with a grand 
          finale concert, featuring a leading singer or DJ who sets the stage ablaze.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Signature events like 
          <span className="font-semibold"> Eternal Echoes</span>, the premier talk show 
          that attracts eminent speakers from across India, the 
          <span className="font-semibold"> SPIC-MACAY</span> performance, Band Night, 
          Cultural Night, and Drama Night ensure that every evening brings a fresh 
          wave of artistry, inspiration, and entertainment.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Eternia is more than a fest — it’s a celebration of talent, creativity, 
          and community that keeps growing brighter each year.
